Transaction Execution → Confirmation & Notification
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Transaction initiator creates and submits transaction request
2. System routes approval requests to required signers
3. Signers review and approve/reject transactions
4. System collects required signatures
5. Executes transaction on XRPL
6. Sends confirmations to all parties

### 3. Key Management Workflow

```
Key Rotation Request → Approval Process → New Key Generation → 
Key Distribution → Wallet Reconfiguration → Old Key Retirement
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Key rotation request initiated by authorized user
2. Approval process follows multi-signature requirements
3. New keys generated and distributed securely
4. Wallet reconfigured with new key set
5. Old keys retired and invalidated

### 4. Compliance and Audit Workflow

```
Activity Monitoring → Compliance Checking → Report Generation → 
Audit Trail Maintenance → Regulatory Reporting
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Continuous monitoring of all wallet activities
2. Automated compliance rule checking
