## Priority Assessment
Based on the product roadmap and current implementation status, the following priorities are identified:

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Codebase Analysis**: Understand current implementation
2. **Feature Gap Analysis**: Identify missing core features
3. **Testing Assessment**: Evaluate current test coverage
4. **Documentation Review**: Align code with documentation

### Medium Priority (Next Phase)
1. **Wallet Import**: Core functionality for multi-sig wallet management
2. **Transaction Coordination**: Essential for multi-signature workflows
3. **Real-time Updates**: Critical for collaborative workflows
4. **Security Implementation**: Multi-factor authentication and audit logging

### Low Priority (Future Phases)
1. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design improvements
2. **Analytics**: Advanced reporting and analytics
3. **Enterprise Features**: Compliance and advanced workflow management
4. **Production Deployment**: Kubernetes and monitoring setup

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Medium - Complex XRPL integration and security requirements
- **Timeline Risk**: Medium - Ambitious feature set for timeline
- **Resource Risk**: Low - Well-documented and structured project
- **Security Risk**: High - Multi-signature wallet security is critical

## Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality with comprehensive testing
- **Feature Completeness**: Implement all core features from roadmap
- **Security**: Zero security vulnerabilities in production
