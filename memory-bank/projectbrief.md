*Last Updated: 2025-01-27*

## Project Overview
The XRPL Multi-Sign Manager is a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution for managing multi-signature wallets on the XRP Ledger. The application focuses on **workflow coordination** rather than private key storage, allowing users to manage multi-sig wallets using their existing trusted wallets (Ledger, Xaman, etc.). This non-custodial approach provides enhanced security while simplifying complex blockchain operations.

## Core Requirements

### Security Requirements
- **Non-Custodial Security**: No private key storage - users maintain full control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP, SMS, hardware security keys, biometric authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and transparency
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)

### Functional Requirements
- **Wallet Import & Management**: Import existing multi-sig wallets by address or QR code
- **External Signer Management**: Add signers by public address with weight assignment
- **Transaction Coordination**: Create proposals and collect signatures from external wallets
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-based live updates for all operations
- **Multi-Network Support**: Testnet, mainnet, and devnet support
- **Mobile Responsive**: Access from any device with touch-friendly interface

### Technical Requirements
- **XRPL Integration**: Direct integration with XRPL nodes for transaction handling
- **External Wallet Support**: Integration with Ledger, Xaman, XUMM, and generic XRPL wallets
- **High Performance**: < 200ms API response time, < 2s page load times
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users, 1,000+ TPS
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime with < 4 hours RTO, < 1 hour RPO

### Compliance Requirements
- **KYC/AML Integration**: Identity verification and risk assessment
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated reporting for BSA, AML, OFAC compliance
- **Data Protection**: GDPR, CCPA compliance with data retention policies
- **Audit Compliance**: External audit readiness with comprehensive logging

## Success Criteria
- **User Adoption**: 1,000+ active users within 6 months
- **Transaction Volume**: $100M+ in transaction volume within 12 months
- **Security**: Zero security breaches, 100% audit compliance
- **Performance**: < 200ms response time, 99.9% uptime
- **Customer Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating, < 5% churn rate
