# Active Context: XRPL Multi-Sign Manager
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27*
*Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH*

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the **START phase completion** and transitioning to **RESEARCH mode**. The CursorRIPER Framework has been successfully initialized with comprehensive project documentation and memory bank setup. The focus is now on understanding the existing codebase and identifying the next development priorities.

## Recent Changes
- **2025-01-27**: CursorRIPER Framework initialization completed
- **2025-01-27**: Memory bank created with comprehensive project documentation
- **2025-01-27**: Project brief, technical context, and system patterns documented
- **2025-01-27**: Existing project structure analyzed and documented

## Active Decisions
- **Framework Adoption**: CursorRIPER Framework adopted for structured development workflow
- **Documentation Strategy**: Comprehensive memory bank established for project intelligence
- **Development Approach**: Non-custodial, coordination-focused multi-signature management
- **Technology Stack**: Confirmed React/Node.js/PostgreSQL/Redis stack with XRPL integration

## Next Steps
1. **Enter RESEARCH Mode**: Analyze existing codebase and identify current implementation status
2. **Code Review**: Examine backend and frontend implementations for completeness
3. **Feature Assessment**: Evaluate which features from the roadmap are implemented
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing components and implementation priorities
5. **Development Planning**: Create detailed development plan for next phase

## Current Challenges
- **Codebase Understanding**: Need to thoroughly analyze existing implementation
- **Feature Completeness**: Determine which roadmap features are implemented
- **Testing Coverage**: Assess current test coverage and quality
- **Documentation Alignment**: Ensure code matches documented architecture

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Project initialization and framework setup
- [✓] Comprehensive project documentation
- [✓] Memory bank establishment
- [✓] Technology stack confirmation
- [✓] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Codebase analysis and assessment
- [ ] Feature completeness evaluation
- [ ] Development priority identification
- [ ] Next phase planning

## Current Development Status
The project appears to have a solid foundation with:
- **Backend**: Express.js API with XRPL integration, authentication, and database models
- **Frontend**: React application with TypeScript and modern UI components
- **Infrastructure**: Docker setup with PostgreSQL, Redis, and development tools
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive product specification and technical documentation

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Research Phase**: Deep dive into existing codebase
2. **Status Assessment**: Determine what's working and what needs development
3. **Feature Mapping**: Align implemented features with product roadmap
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate code quality, testing, and documentation
5. **Next Phase Planning**: Identify immediate development priorities

## Framework Integration
- **Current Phase**: START phase completed, transitioning to DEVELOPMENT phase
- **Current Mode**: RESEARCH (will be set upon transition)
- **Memory Bank**: Fully established with all core documents
- **State Management**: Framework state properly configured and updated
