## Notes and Decisions

### Strategic Decisions
- **Product Positioning**: Shifted from "Multi-Signature Wallet Manager" to "Multi-Signature Coordinator" ✅
- **Security Model**: Adopted non-custodial approach - no private key storage ✅
- **User Experience**: Focus on coordination workflows rather than key management ✅
- **Target Market**: Emphasize enterprise coordination and compliance ✅

### Technical Decisions
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo with backend, frontend, and shared packages
- **Technology Stack**: React + TypeScript (Frontend), Node.js + Express + TypeScript (Backend), PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Database Schema**: Non-custodial design with external signers and wallet imports
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel delivery with user preferences and do not disturb mode

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, OAuth support (Google, Apple)
- **XRPL Integration**: Direct node connections with fallback nodes
- **Security**: Multi-layer security with encryption, RBAC, and audit logging
- **Notification**: Comprehensive system with push, email, SMS, and WebSocket support

### Timeline Adjustments
- **Added Week 7-8.5**: Strategic shift to non-custodial model
- **Added Week 8-9**: New user onboarding features
- **Added Week 9-10**: Comprehensive notification system
- **Updated Progress**: Phase 1 now 85% complete (61/72 tasks)
